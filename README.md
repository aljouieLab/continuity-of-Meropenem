# continuity of Meropenem
This is part of a project approved by the IRB at KAIMRC with study number (protocol no: NRC23R/586/10) to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models in giving a decision of whether to continue or discontinueMeropenem beyond the initial 48-hours for pediatric patients using a set of features: 
  1. Indication for Meropenem
  2. CNS infection?
  3. Infective Endocarditis?
  4. Is patient clinical status worsening?
  5. Is he patient syndrome explained by non-infectious etiology?
  6. Appropriate Cultures Collected prior to Meropenem
  7. Any of the pertinent cultures in the current event are positive for a pathogenic organism
  8. Any of the following GNB with resistant pattern isolated in current event cultures (ESBL, AmpC, Ceftriaxone/Ceftazidime Resistant)
  9. Any  GNB with Carbapenem resistant isolated in event admission cultures
  10. Any of the following GNB with resistant pattern isolated in colonization or infection in last 6 months
  11. Admission to another hospital/ICU in the last 6 months
  12. Any of the following antibiotics in last 30 days (Tazocin, Cefepime, Meropenem)
  13. Allergy to any of the following antibiotics (Ampicillin/Amoxicillin, Penicillin, Ceftriaxone/Ceftazidime, Tazocin, Cefepime)
